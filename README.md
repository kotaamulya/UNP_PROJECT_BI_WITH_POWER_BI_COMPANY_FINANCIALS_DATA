# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA
I completed Power Bi project in collaboration with UNP Education, analyzing a company's financial dataset using Power BI. The project focuses on sales trends, profit margins, discount impact, and segment performance. I performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to create interactive dashboards with key insights. Visuals include KPI indicators, bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to track financial performance. The project identifies high-revenue products, profitable segments, and discount effects. This repository contains Power BI reports (.pbix), dataset files, and documentation detailing the analysis process.
